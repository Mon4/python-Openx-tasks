To draw the graph firstly install in command line:
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

Then run it from command line:
python main.py

Due to lack of time program isn't polished out and optimized. solution consists of two scripts: load.py and main.py.
load.py runs for a longer time, it visits domains for indirect sellers and saves them to file.
I've attached downloaded data filename.pickle and also Figure.png generated in main.py which shows the graph built on downloaded data.
